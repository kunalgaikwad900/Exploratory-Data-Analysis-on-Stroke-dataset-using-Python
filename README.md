# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Stroke-dataset-using-Python
Performed exploratory data analysis using various data visualization techniques
Executed data wrangling to remove 2 unnecessary features, check for null values and remove outliers from 1 feature for better analysis.
Inferred dataset to be slightly imbalanced, since 58.6% of patients were female and 55-60 years group was at maximum risk of stroke.
Concluded abnormal Body Mass Index, abnormal glucose and smoking as top three factors contributing for stroke among patients.
